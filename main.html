      <p>Health is fundamental for a good quality of life. Being free from illness or injury directly affects our
         capacity to enjoy life.<br>
         In this entry we provide an overview of the available empirical evidence on aggregate health outcomes, focusing
         on long-run cross-country data from mortality and morbidity tables; and then provide an analysis of available
         evidence on health determinants, focusing specifically on the returns to macro healthcare investments.<br>
         Life expectancy is the most commonly used measure used to describe a population health. Historical data shows
         that global life expectancy has increased drastically over the last couple of centuries, with substantial
         long-run improvements in all countries around the world. In fact, recent life expectancy gains in developing
         countries have been particularly important. However, despite recent progress towards long-run cross-country
         convergence, there are still huge differences that have to be addressed: in several countries in Sub-Saharan
         Africa the average life expectancy is still less than 60 years, compared to more than 80 years in countries in
         Europe or in Japan.<br>
         Historical reductions in child mortality and maternal mortality have been crucial to improving life expectancy
         around the world. But also for these two measures of health we observe large remaining inequalities: low-income
         countries still have, on average, child mortality rates that are more than ten times higher than those in
         high-income countries. We show that similarly large gaps remain for other measures of health, including recent
         burden-of-disease estimates.<br>
         A growing body of empirical research suggests that, at a macro level, health outcomes are highly responsive to
         healthcare investments. Moreover, as one would expect, the evidence suggests large health returns to healthcare
         expenditure at low levels of baseline expenditure. This implies that international resources channeled through
         development assistance for health, if suitably targeted and managed, have the potential of drastically reducing
         global inequalities in living standards.</p><br><br><br>
      <p>Exercise and Yoga is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, contributing to the longevity and your quality
         of life. A well-rounded fitness program includes aerobic, strength, core, balance and flexibility training.
         Including yoga along with cardiovascular and strength training helps you fit in all of these components as well
         as reduce stress</p>

            <p>Benefits of Exercise
               The Harvard School of Public Health explains that regular exercise protects you from heart disease,
               stroke, high blood pressure, certain cancers, Type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. As you age, exercise
               helps you stay functional and helps prevent falling, which can lead to serious complications. Exercise is
               intrinsic to weight management and efficient lung and heart function. You may experience less depression
               and anxiety with regular exercise.</p>
